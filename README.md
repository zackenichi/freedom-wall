# Freedom Wall

Freedom Wall is a simple web application that enables users to post messages anonymously. The unique feature of this project is that messages automatically disappear after 10 minutes.

## Features

- **Anonymous Posting:** Users can post messages without revealing their identity.
- **Message Expiry:** Messages automatically disappear after 10 minutes.
- **Minimalistic Design:** A clean and straightforward user interface for a seamless experience.

## Why Freedom Wall?

In fostering anonymity, we seek to create an environment where honesty flourishes, barriers crumble, and users feel unencumbered to express themselves authentically. This project challenges the norms of conventional social platforms, putting the focus on the message rather than the messenger.

## Other motivations?

This Project shows practical applications of real time data fetching without the need for signup or authentication.

## Limits

Added limit of post once every 5 mins.
